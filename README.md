# Autoencoder-Text-Images
This is a deep learning project using a Autoencoder neural network to clean text images with spots and wrinkles. Pytorch is used to build the neural network.

For this purpose, I developt two architectures based on MultiLater
Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks. As results, a convolutional
neural network shows a better performance cleaning the text images and
consuming less memory space.
